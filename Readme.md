# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🔍 What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It helps in understanding the data, detecting patterns, spotting anomalies, and testing hypotheses before applying machine learning models.

## 🚀 Why is EDA Important?
- Identifies missing or incorrect data.
- Helps in feature selection and engineering.
- Provides insights into data distribution and relationships.
- Improves model performance by refining data preprocessing.

## 📈 Visualization
### Important Charts for Visualization
- **Histogram** 📊 - For understanding data distribution.
- **Boxplot** 📦 - For detecting outliers.
- **Scatter Plot** 🎯 - For identifying relationships between two variables.
- **Correlation Heatmap** 🔥 - For finding feature correlations.
- **Bar Chart** 📶 - For categorical data representation.
- **Pair Plot** 🤝 - For multi-variable relationships.

## 📝 Steps Involved in EDA
### 1️⃣ Data Sourcing
   - Collect data from various sources (CSV, databases, APIs, etc.).

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
   - Handle missing values.
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Correct data types.

### 3️⃣ Univariate Analysis with Visualization
   - Analyze individual variables using histograms, boxplots, and descriptive statistics.

### 4️⃣ Bivariate Analysis with Visualization
   - Explore relationships between two variables using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.

### 5️⃣ Derived Metrics
   - Create new features based on existing ones to enhance analysis and model performance.

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Customer behavior analysis 📊
- Fraud detection 🚨
- Healthcare analytics 🏥
- Marketing campaign analysis 📢
- Financial risk assessment 💰
