Outliers in Data Analysis
==========================

Definition:
-----------
An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set.

Types of Outliers:
------------------
1. Univariate Outliers: Outliers in one-dimensional data.
2. Multivariate Outliers: Outliers in multi-dimensional data.

Causes of Outliers:
-------------------
1. Data entry errors.
2. Measurement errors.
3. Experimental errors.
4. Natural variation in data.
5. Changes in system behavior.

Identifying Outliers:
---------------------
1. Visualization: Using box plots, scatter plots, or histograms.
2. Statistical Methods: Using Z-scores, IQR (Interquartile Range), or Grubbs' test.

Handling Outliers:
------------------
1. Removing Outliers: If the outlier is due to an error, it can be removed.
2. Transforming Data: Applying transformations like log or square root to reduce the impact of outliers.
3. Imputing Outliers: Replacing outliers with a measure like mean or median.
4. Using Robust Methods: Employing statistical methods that are less sensitive to outliers.
